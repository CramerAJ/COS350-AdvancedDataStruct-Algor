The two classes, are two different approaches I had to the homework, after a few issues with my laptop
having a new update on OSX installed,causing a few issues with the application eclipse. The first
was my original attempt, using the written part of the homework psuedocode as a guide for what I need
to have in my function. Was honestly not entirely sure as what was the main issue, whether I was 
recalling the function incorrectly, or whether I was also not storing them properly.

Which made me then switch to a hashmap. I wasn't very familiar with hashmaps, but tried my best to implement a version
using the data structure. Asked a few students if they could send me some links to help me get started. 
Although I was able to come up with something, I wasn't to sure on how to actually output the keys. I knew 
of cases however for the hashmap, that there would be duplicate key/values, which would be pairs/edges in the map
numerous times. Since each vertex is created with having all it's pairs, since it's an undirected graph.

Would also like to come meet with you after this assignment, to talk about what my issues were in both 
methods, as I had a pretty tough time understanding some of the issues I encountered debugging the 
algorithms.

FIXED IT,early this morning, may still have issues, on 4/1/16
