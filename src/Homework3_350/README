Used this site, since I was making some very dumb mistakes one night
so just decided to find a solution.

General Comments:

My original approach to the task, was to have three nested for loops, that would pick up the first index
assign it to a variable, then pick up the second and assign it to another variable, and then pick up the third
index in the list. So there would be i, i+1, and i+2. It would then compare find a set of indexes, that when
(i+1)-i == (i+2)-(i+1), it would store that pair into an ArrayList for integers. Yet having it already found and stored 
later wouldn't really make much sense. So ended up just having it stored to an ArrayList<Strings>, and would then output
using a for loop to output a string containing the three indexes that work. It finds all duplicates if the 
indexes are the same value, but not the same positions.
