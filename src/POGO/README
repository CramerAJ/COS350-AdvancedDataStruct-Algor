Comments: I made very minor changes when taking homework 1. Had several issues on trying to
get the inputs to separate, so ended up just asking a few people in class as well as looked up
a few different ways on Stack Overflow. I hope I didn't fully misunderstand the point of this assignment
, but from what I thought we had to do was take the cost of the pogos and add them up, which I attempted, but 
was unable to do so. I ended up making sure that it was at least able to separate the values of the 
cost of the pogo when given the coins amount, and still being able to find the total cost of each
combination. I also tried to find the minimum cost pattern to reach the goal, but since the 
cost value for each itteration was the same as well as wasn't being added up correctly I eventually just gave up. 
I did find a few different re attempts to try, but nothing seemed to really work.
Tried my best on this, but really just couldn't find a way to have to coins add up.
